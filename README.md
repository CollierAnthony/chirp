# Chirp twitter clone

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## Technologies

Chirp is built on a modern stack that includes the following technologies:

- [Prisma](https://prisma.io): A powerful database toolkit that simplifies database management and enables developers to build highly scalable and performant applications. Prisma offers a range of features, including a type-safe database client, an intuitive data modeling language, and a powerful schema generator. With its seamless integration with TypeScript, Prisma helps to catch errors and bugs early in the development process and makes the code more reliable and maintainable.

- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/): A user authentication and authorization platform that makes it easy to integrate secure and user-friendly authentication into any application. Clerk offers a range of features, including passwordless authentication, customizable sign-up and login forms, and multi-factor authentication.

- [tRPC](https://trpc.io): A real-time communication framework that enables Chirp to deliver real-time updates and notifications to users in an efficient and reliable way. tRPC is built on top of TypeScript and provides strong typing support, a type-safe mechanism for serializing and deserializing data, and a type-safe mechanism for handling events. It also includes an automatic code generator that can save time and reduce the amount of boilerplate code developers need to write.

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): A utility-first CSS framework that makes it easy to create responsive and customizable user interfaces. With its extensive set of pre-defined styles and easy-to-use class-based syntax, Tailwind CSS enables developers to create complex layouts and styles with minimal effort. Its modular architecture and customizable configuration also make it highly adaptable to different project requirements.

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org): A production-ready framework that enables server-side rendering and makes it easy to build static and dynamic web applications. Next.js offers a range of features, including automatic code splitting, optimized image loading, and serverless functions. With its seamless integration with React, Next.js enables developers to build fast and scalable applications with minimal configuration.
